Google Ads is a powerful tool to advertise online and reach people who never heard of your cause before simply by using their search behaviour. But should your charity take advantage of this tool? With so many conditions, do you have the time to keep up with your account? Is your website ready at all to send paid traffic there?

As much as Google Ads is another arrow in the quiver, you must plan strategically and define your goals in advance. A user-friendly website with a well-defined call-to-action are the first step to take before launching a paid ad.

If you have what it takes, then read on and see if Google Ads is your next marketing step.

# Should you use G.Ads for your charity?

## What it implies

Online paid advertising is not suitable for every kind of businesses and it certainly applies to charities too.

Although Google Ads is giving away ¬£7,000 to eligible charities, it doesn‚Äôt mean this fit your cause.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs hard to find reasons not to apply, but be sure that you understand how to maintain your ad account and how to best effectively reach people online.

Ask yourself HOW and WHAT you want your audience to do when they interact with your ads online:

- Do you want them to donate directly?
- Do you want them to subscribe to a newsletter?
- Do you want them to become a partner?
- Do you want them to find your nearest local store?
- Do you want to find new volunteers?

All these are valid questions. And these must lead you to a strategy & a plan of action.

From my experience, a paid campaign for the sake of traffic & brand awareness is sometimes of poor performance for charities. Why? People don‚Äôt want to click on an ad to find out about a charity. 

Have you ever heard some people moaning: ‚Äúwhere does this money come from? I thought they were a charity!‚Äù 

You‚Äôd be better off with organic marketing effort when it comes to brand awareness & engagement rather than using ads.

By using the power of Google Ads for performing an action, people are more inclined with the idea of a charity investing for donation or get something out of their audience (e.g. a sign up or a share).

If you decide to go ahead with Google Ads, make sure you understand the mechanic of a campaign, an ad group and the nitty gritty.

Use the right conversion actions, target the right audience and read all G.Ads recommendations (this is part of the conditions).

üîó Eligibility: [https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/nonprofits/eligibility/](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/nonprofits/eligibility/)

## üëçüèª Pros

- Reach a wider audience & get more traffic thanks to the ads
- Use display ads to reach more platforms
- Make it more apparent what you action you want your audience to perform
- This is free money!

## üëéüèª Cons

- The conditions are limiting your reach and potential donations
- the keywords selection might not always fit your needs/purposes
- Although you drive traffic to your website, people might not be interested in donating
(so your conversion is lower than regular accounts, which can drop your CTR)
- you have to maintain your account regularly to avoid suspension.
If you don‚Äôt have the time or manpower to keep checking your google ads account, you might pass on some warnings resulting in suspension of your ad account. A CTR keeps changing everyday, it can fall and rise sharply in a few days, which is why it‚Äôs important to keep track of your progression.

# Conditions to maintain your account

## No single-word keywords permitted

Sad news. Your campaigns won‚Äôt be shown for single-word keywords. 

You will have to use 2+ keywords instead, which could be seen as limited for many.

If you do your research beforehand however, you might get inspired by the choices you are facing.

## No overly generic keywords permitted

On top of not bidding on single-word keywords, you can‚Äôt use general search terms.

I‚Äôm guessing ‚Äúdonate now‚Äù will be one of them, and these keywords will have to be specific to your cause. 

## No keywords with a quality score of 1 or 2 permitted

Your keywords must be relevant and can‚Äôt fall under Quality Score 2.

So make sure your landing page mentions the keywords in question and that your ads are relevant to the purpose & messaging.

As you get more impressions and clicks with your keywords, then later on, make sure your expected CTR is high enough to keep these keywords running.

If they don‚Äôt perform anymore, you will have to pause them before they drop your overall CTR and make more damage than necessary.

üîó What does Quality Score entails: [https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6167118](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6167118?visit_id=637807240124021533-2237243141&rd=1)

## Must maintain a 5% click-through rate (CTR) each month

This is where the challenge lies.

You must make sure your overall ad account doesn‚Äôt fall under 5% CTR within 2 consecutive months.

How to do that? CTR is mostly affected by the performance of your ads and the relevancy of the landing page. If you edit your landing page or start making changes to your ads, make sure they are all in sync and you are still relevant to your audience.

But your expected traffic & audience interest in your cause could have some up and down as the days go by, so keep an eye out with the trends and how best to reach them consistently throughout the year.

## Must have valid conversion tracking

You‚Äôll be surprised how often I see big clients‚Äô ad account with wrong conversion tracking. And the same happens for charity accounts.

Your conversion actions are telling Google what action you want your audience to take. So try imagine if your conversion action are wrongly setup or invalid.

For example, I helped out a charity where they wanted people to submit requests and donate on their website. They used Google Tag Manager and linked it with Google Ads & Analytics.

I wanted to test the performance of the Tag Manager and how little I was to find out the container did not connect any longer. The conversion goals were not registering any conversions, Google Ads goals were solely relying on its Smart Goals.

No wonder their campaigns did not perform as expected and that they got little interactions with their website.

So before blaming any campaigns (or volunteers), make sure to check the setup of your conversion goals.

## Must have at least 2 ads per ad group & 2 ad groups per campaign

These 2 conditions are not so bad.

Or you need here, is make sure you have a strategy and a way to separate your ads & campaigns.

As a tip, you can separate your campaigns by audiences, such as, based on interests and remarketing.

So on your dashboard, you‚Äôll be able to tell at first glance which one is performing better than the other.

## Must have at least 2 sitelink ad extensions

This condition should feature for normal accounts to be honest!

Never, ever ever, forget to add sitelinks & extensions to your campaigns.

They are so useful and more impactful that we give them credit for. You don‚Äôt need a whole strategy behind them. You can start off by adding the main pages of your website.

## Must respond to the programme survey

I‚Äôve never seen one of this survey myself, but I hear they are fairly straightforward to do.

If you keep up with that one last condition, then you are golden!
