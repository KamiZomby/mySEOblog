# What are internal links and their different types
### What are internal links
Internal links are links that navigate a user within a website.
These links are all based on the website's URL and have the function to connect with one page to another.

### The different types
**- Navigational links**
\
Any links that are part of the menu or the footer are considered navigation links.
Let's not forget breadcrumbs that are also an indication of how to navigate say website.

**- Content links**
\
Also known as "Anchor Links", these are pieces of text that are clickable.

**- Image links**
\
Although this practice is decreasing in popularity, internal links can be used on images. These links typically redirects to a downloadable document or serve a navigation.

# Why are they important?
### Establish the hierarchy
Internal links help create the hierarchy of your website.
It helps users understand the path you want them to take on your website, while you tell Google the level of "authority" your pages hold.

By "authority", we refer to the "vote" you give to your pages.

For example, if you use a lot of internal links to the homepage, Google will understand that the page is the most important page. Then if you use links on the homepage to one other page, Google will assume that this is a secondary page/level.

Let's take a blog page.
\
If you have a page that holds all your blog posts and there's a pagination, Google will prioritise blog posts seen on page 1, and "de-prioritise" those on page 5+.
It's also an indication to Google of the age of the posts.
